# CSS-Animations

This is a collection of nice and interesting CSS animations and hover effects that I started collecting after taking a course from Udemy.

You can try it live here: https://kovdimay.github.io/CSS-Animations/

The idea of this website is to keep all the effects in one place and in a way that it is easy to get the code and reuse it in a different place. This is why you see this structure of each page, where each type of animation or effect goes one after another in a clear order and with a clear naming, so everyone is able to just copy-paste the HTML and corresponding CSS from this project and it magically works in another project too. And even if it requires some changes of the CSS - they are super minor and simple.

I want to collect here as many interesting effects as possible so if you know some - you are welcome to contribute. But please, try to keep the same approach and the same structure of the code. Thank you in advance! :)
