# CSS-Animations

This is a collection of interesting and beautiful CSS animations that I started collecting after taking a course from Udemy.

You can see the current result here: https://kovdimay.github.io/CSS-Animations/

The idea is to keep the effects in a way when it is easy to reuse them in a different place. By this I mean to be able just copy-paste the HTML and CSS from this project and it magically works in a new project. Or even if it requires some changes - they are super minor.

I want to collect here as many interesting effects as possible so if you know some - you are welcome to contribute. But please, try to keep the same approach and the same structure of the code. Thank you in advance! :)
